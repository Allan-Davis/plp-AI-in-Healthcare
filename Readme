# AI in Healthcare: Predicting Diabetes Risk Using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Description
This project uses artificial intelligence (AI) to predict diabetes risk based on patient health data. Using the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, we apply a machine learning model to identify individuals at risk and demonstrate how AI can support early diagnosis in healthcare.

## 🎯 Objectives
- Build a diabetes prediction model using machine learning.
- Evaluate model accuracy and performance.
- Show how AI can assist in early disease detection and improve healthcare outcomes.

## 🛠️ Tools and Libraries Used
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn
- Scikit-learn (Random Forest Classifier)

## ▶️ How to Run the Project
1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Open `diabetes_prediction.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
3. Run all cells from top to bottom to train and test the model.

## 💡 Insights and Reflections
- The Random Forest Classifier achieved strong accuracy in predicting diabetes.
- Cleaning and preprocessing the data (e.g., replacing zero values) improved model performance.
- This simple project shows how AI can play a role in preventive healthcare by identifying high-risk patients early.
